# change-file-mtime-to-ctime
Python script to change the modification time (mtime) of files in a directory to match creation time (ctime).

Move the script to the desired directory and run it with python3 changefilemtimetoctime.py. It will only update files in that directory and not recurse. You can specify file types to be ignored in line 19.
